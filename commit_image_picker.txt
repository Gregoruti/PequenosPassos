feat(mvp-07): Implement ImagePicker component with camera and gallery

Component Features:
- Camera capture with ActivityResultContract
- Gallery selection with content picker
- Image preview with aspect ratio preserved
- Remove button with confirmation
- Automatic image resizing (max 1024px by default)
- Local storage with FileProvider
- Permission handling (Camera, Read External Storage)
- Material 3 design with rounded corners
- Two variants: ImagePicker (with preview) and CompactImagePicker

Files Created:
1. ImagePicker.kt (presentation/components)
   - ImagePicker composable with camera and gallery launchers
   - CompactImagePicker without preview (space-saving variant)
   - ImagePreview internal composable with remove button
   - Helper functions for image handling:
     * createTempImageFile() - Creates temp file for camera
     * resizeAndSaveImage() - Resizes and saves to local storage
     * calculateNewDimensions() - Maintains aspect ratio

2. ImagePickerPreview.kt (presentation/components)
   - 4 preview variants for development
   - Empty state, dark mode, compact version, multiple pickers

3. ImagePickerTest.kt (test)
   - 13 unit tests covering dimension calculations
   - Tests for aspect ratio preservation
   - Edge cases: landscape, portrait, square images
   - Size limits validation (max 1024px)

4. file_paths.xml (res/xml)
   - FileProvider configuration for image sharing
   - Pictures directory for camera images
   - Cache directory for temporary files

5. AndroidManifest.xml (updated)
   - Added CAMERA permission
   - Added READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission (maxSdk 32)
   - Added camera feature (not required)
   - Added FileProvider configuration

Image Processing:
- Automatic resizing maintaining aspect ratio
- Quality: JPEG 90% compression
- Max size: 1024px (configurable)
- File naming: IMG_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.jpg
- Storage: External files directory (Pictures/)

Permission Handling:
- Camera permission request for Android 13+
- Gallery access through content picker
- FileProvider for secure file sharing
- Runtime permission launcher integrated

Features:
- Preview with 200dp height
- Remove button with Material 3 error container colors
- Placeholder state with icon and text
- Two-button layout: Camera | Gallery
- Coil library for image loading (already in dependencies)
- Error handling for file operations

This completes the third (and most complex) component of MVP-07 Phase 2.
Next: Create comprehensive documentation and integration examples.
