refactor(mvp-07): Update minimum timer duration from 15s to 5s

Updated timer range throughout the project:
- Step.kt: Changed durationSeconds validation from 15-600s to 5-600s
- StepTest.kt: Updated tests to validate 5s minimum (added test for 5s, changed fail test to 4s)
- Documentation updated (5 files):
  - MVP07_PANORAMA_GERAL.md
  - MVP07_WIREFRAMES.md
  - MVP07_FASE1_VALIDATION.md
  - MVP07_FASE1_CHECKLIST.md
  - CHANGELOG.md

Rationale:
- More flexible for quick tasks (5s minimum instead of 15s)
- Slider component confirmed as UI choice
- Better user experience for short steps

All tests remain passing with new validation range.
